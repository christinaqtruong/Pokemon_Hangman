#Pokemon Hangman Word Guess Game
This Word Guess Game is a vanilla JavaScript application that allows users to guess first generation Pokemon from the Pokemon franchise. Once a letter is inputted from the keyboard, the application checks if it matches the letters of the randomly selected Pokemon and updates the user interface accordingly.
